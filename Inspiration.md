# Game Inspiration
My main inspirations came from considering what I like, as I want to design a game that I would actually play. I enjoy games with cute and cozy vibes, as well as mystical creatures. I have always loved dragons so I do think having a dragon as the player character could be really fun! I also enjoy telling stories, having done some creative writing, and enjoying narrating for games and such. This makes me want to focus on a game that has some sort of story, character development, or other plot that drives what happens. But I also want to have unique/interesting mechanics that will keep players engaged. Even though I personally never played Hollow Knight, I've watched enough playthroughs of it to know this is a great example. If I could make a platforming game that is even a tiny fraction as interesting as this game, that would be super cool!
I want to design a game that has a little bit for everyone. I want it to be challenging, engaging, rewarding of hard work, and have an interesting story users can get attached to.
