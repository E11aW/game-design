# Program 2: Basic Interaction Model

## Drag and Drop Interaction Model
### Description
The drag and drop interaction model enables the user to interact with the game world by moving around different objects with their cursor. This was the simplified version of the worldbuilding interaction model I mentioned during the asynchronous discussion. Instead of moving around whole buildings and cities on a world map, I instead focused on a smaller scale. Still, objects are placed in locations determined by the user when they click on and drag those items around the screen, visually changing how the game looks.
### Objectives
The model objectives are to immediately show the effects of user input. The fact that each object is visually in a different and unique location proves that the user has control over the game world and can alter it to suit their preferences. It is a relatively simple way of interacting with the game world and has a lot of use-cases in video games.
### Game Usage
Many video games use the drag and drop method to some capacity, even when it is not the core game mechanic. In my game I focused on an inventory style, having predetermined slots where each item can go and allowing the items to be dragged into any of those empty slots while preventing any misplacement outside the inventory or inside a filled slot. However, more complex games can allow a wider variety of objects to be dragged around, including characters or buildings. The drag and drop interaction model is useful because of its variety and variability, and I only implemented it on a relatively small and simple scale. Practicing implementing this interaction will be helpful moving forward with further game development.
