Game Design Principles  
By Ella Williams

## Game Balance
### Game Examples
Multiplayer games need to be balanced to be enjoyable by every player: there needs to be a way to catch up. This is why I would consider Mario Kart to be balanced since they purposefully give stronger items to players in the back.
### Pros & Cons
|Pros  |Cons  |
|------|------|
|<ul><li>Easier to learn</li><li>Increase retention & satisfaction</li><li>Improve engagement</li></ul>|<ul><li>Less exciting if too much unifromity</li><li>Needing to relearn the game mechanics</li><li>Could be challenging to properly balance the game</li></ul>|
### Use cases
I believe every game needs some sort of balance, so I would definitely want to implement this game design principle in my game. A good way to make sure a game is balanced is to ensure every challenge is fair. I would avoid making the player too strong or too weak compared to enemies or obstacles so that everything is beatable but not boring.
## Narrative Appeal
### Game Examples
I feel as though the strength of a game's narrative could be rather subjective, and I prefer games with more of a loose narrative. Games I have played that I thought had nice narratives were both modern Legend of Zelda games, Fallout 4, and Pokemon Black 2 (I believe this is one the Pokemon games with a good narrative that is not overtaking the game). 
### Pros & Cons
|Pros  |Cons  |
|------|------|
|<ul><li>Connect user to the characters</li><li>Increase immersion</li><li>Improves worldbuilding</li><li>Add more to overall interest</li><li>Drive plot and pacing</li></ul>|<ul><li>Can overtake the gameplay</li><li>Limit player freedom</li><li>Unnecessary for mechanics-focused games</li></ul>|
### Use cases
There are a lot of subtle ways to add narrative appeal to my game, whether that be adding some backstory or meaning to the player character or putting more effort into worldbuilding. Even having a clear and well represented theme can help elevate a game's appeal for users.
## Feedback Loops
### Game Examples
Two games I play with very different but equally strong feedback loops are Stardew Valley and Civilization 6. Stardew Valley has a relatively simple feedback loop: use a skill to improve it. This allows the player to gain new skills and  see real progress from each of their actions. Civilization games have a very prominent positive feedback loop as every building or unit produced from a city brings the user closer to some form of victory.
### Pros & Cons
|Pros  |Cons  |
|------|------|
|<ul><li>Continuous growth & improvement</li><li>Increased engagement</li><li>Clear way to attain goals</li></ul>|<ul><li>Overcomplicating game design</li><li>Negative consequences too strong</li><li>Feeling too repetitive</li></ul>|
### Use cases
I would prioritize a positive feedback loop for players so they feel accomplished after playing. Player actions need to feel like they have meaning and are accomplishing something, otherwise they might feel lost or unsure how to even progress. I would probably implement this through some sort of experience or currency system that rewards players.
