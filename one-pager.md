Game Design Principles  
By Ella Williams

## Game Balance
### Game Examples
Multiplayer games need to be balanced to be enjoyable by every player: there needs to be a way to catch up. This is why I would consider Mario Kart to be balanced since they purposefully give stronger items to players in the back. Another way to balance a game is to avoid outside factors from affecting success, like cheating. Rocket League is often considered a well balanced game because one's success is fully based on skill and skill alone.
### Pros & Cons
|Pros  |Cons  |
|------|------|
|<ul><li>Easier to learn</li><li>Increase retention & satisfaction</li><li>Improve engagement</li></ul>|<ul><li>Less exciting if too much uniformity</li><li>Needing to relearn the game mechanics</li><li>Could be challenging to properly balance the game</li></ul>|
### Use cases
I believe every game needs some sort of balance, so I would definitely want to implement this game design principle in my game. A good way to make sure a game is balanced is to ensure every challenge is fair. I won't really need to worry about balancing a multiplayer game, so my focus would be in ensuring levels and mechanics are balanced. I would avoid making the player too strong or too weak compared to enemies or obstacles so that everything is beatable/doable, but not a boring walk in the park.
## Narrative Appeal
### Game Examples
I feel as though the strength of a game's narrative could be rather subjective. Looking online, I found that a lot of games mentioned with strong narratives were ones I had never played or watched someone else play. This is probably because I prefer games with more of a loose narrative, where you can still follow along with it but you aren't forced down a certain path to play your part in the story. Games I have played that I thought had nice narratives were both modern Legend of Zelda games, Fallout 4, and Pokemon Black 2 (I believe this is one the Pokemon games with a good narrative that is not overtaking the game). 
### Pros & Cons
|Pros  |Cons  |
|------|------|
|<ul><li>Connect user to the characters</li><li>Increase immersion</li><li>Improves worldbuilding</li><li>Add more to overall interest</li><li>Drive plot and pacing</li></ul>|<ul><li>Can overtake the gameplay</li><li>Limit player freedom</li><li>Unnecessary for mechanics-focused games</li></ul>|
### Use cases
There are a lot of subtle ways to add narrative appeal to my game, whether that be adding some backstory or meaning to the player character or putting more effort into worldbuilding. I still have not finalized my game idea so I am uncertain if it will have a fully fleshed out, overarching story or not, but I do think there are plenty of ways of integrating some sort of narrative into the game. Even having a clear and well represented theme can help elevate a game's appeal for users.
## Feedback Loops
### Game Examples
Two games I play with very different but equally strong feedback loops are Stardew Valley and Civilization 6. Stardew Valley has a relatively simple feedback loop: use a skill to improve it. This allows the player to gain new skills, crafting recipes, and efficiencies based on how they play the game, improving the skills they use most the fastest. This allows users to see real progress from each of their actions, especially once they start making money. Civilization games have a very prominent positive feedback loop as every building or unit produced from a city brings the user closer to some form of victory. There is never a point where the player isn't accomplishing something.
### Pros & Cons
|Pros  |Cons  |
|------|------|
|<ul><li>Continuous growth & improvement</li><li>Increased engagement</li><li>Clear way to attain goals</li></ul>|<ul><li>Overcomplicating game design</li><li>Negative consequences too strong</li><li>Feeling too repetitive</li></ul>|
### Use cases
I would want a positive feedback loop for players so they feel accomplished after playing, no matter how long they may play at a time. Player actions need to feel like they have meaning and are accomplishing something, otherwise they might feel lost or unsure how to even progress. I would probably implement this through some sort of experience gain or currency system that rewards players for their accomplishments.
