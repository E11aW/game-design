# Game Brainstorm
## Current Idea
A type of game I have been interested in designing is a platforming game. I also want to tell some sort of story and include engaging characters that users can connect with. I have a general idea that I am not fully set on yet, but I do think could be pretty interesting. This game idea involves the user playing as a newly hatched dragon that falls from the top of a tower and must climb its way back up. It'll be set up in a similar fashion to other tower-climbing games where you are fighting harder enemies as you ascend the tower before reaching the ultimate, final boss. But instead of a final fight with the boss, I thought it could be interesting to have that as the final goal: to reunite with the mother. 
This idea felt like it had the most potential and could be pretty fun to implement, so it is what I will be focusing on at least for the beginning of this class.
## Other Ideas
- Cozy collecting/foraging game (mushrooms, flowers, herbs, etc.)
    - Collecting cute creatures
- Some sort of puzzle game
- An eerie, maybe spooky dungeon explorer
